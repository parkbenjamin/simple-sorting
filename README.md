# Simple Integer Storage
## Overview
This repository contains short Java classes that each take user-provided integers and then sort and store those integers in different data structures. Currently there are **2** classes:
1. LinkedListFromUserInts
2. StackFromUserInts

When each program is executed, the user will be prompted to provide a list (of any length) of integers. The integers should be entered on a single line separated by spaces (no commas, either as thousands separators or as serial commas). After the user types in the integers and hits `ENTER`, the program sorts all the integers and stores them in the appropriate data structure. The collection of integers is also printed (from lowest to highest).

## Installation and Running the Programs
[Java](https://www.java.com/en/) must first be installed on your machine. (If you need help, [you can find instructions here](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.html)).

In each class's folder there is a **src** folder with the original code (the .java file) and the executable (.class) file. The latter can be run from the command line preceded simply by the word java; for instance, to run the program that generates a sorted linked list from the user's integers, one would simply type `java LinkedListFromUserInts` once in the appropriate directory (or include the full path in the command). The .java file could also be opened in the user's IDE of choice and compiled however the user would like.

## Documentation
Javadocs can be generated from the original source code, or they can be read from the **doc** folder in each java class. Given the relative simplicity of each project here, a single HTML file is provided for documentation.
